    'konten_about' => 'Talaga Paca village consists of 210 families, 95% have their main livelihood as farmers. Prior to the 1980s, the people of Talaga Paca were the Remote Indigenous Community (KAT) who lived in the forest by hunting and gathering Forest Products. The government calls the Indigenous people of  Talaga Paca by the term Tugutil, but they refer to themselves as o hongana ma nyawa which literally means ‘forest people’ or people who come from the forest.

    75% of households in Talaga Paca Village are in the poor category with a per capita income of Rp.300,000 per month. This is a contradiction with the natural wealth of the village in the form of forests, biodiversity and a lake that is the source of water for PDAM Halmahera Utara.

    In 2019, the Minister of Environment and Forestry granted management rights to 865 hectares of forest area to Talaga Paca Village for 35 years based on SK.8109/menlhk-pskl/pkps/psl.0/9/2019 in the form of a village forest  as part of the Social Forestry program. The granting of management rights was accompanied by the assignment of a companion for the Forest Management Institution (LPHD) of Talaga Paca.

    The current development strategy is through ecotourism. The active involvement of the community and the support of stakeholders are crucial for the development of Talaga Paca ecotourism in order to realize the vision of a sustainable nature of Talaga Paca and a prosperous society.

            The theme of the event was “Becoming a Professional and Ecologically Responsible Athlete and Shooting Sports Enthusiast”. Through this theme, hopefully shooting will return to its main function as a professional sport, not for indiscriminate hunting of wild animals which are important for the natural ecosystem, as is often done by a number of individuals in society.
